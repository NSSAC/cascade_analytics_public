# Computing properties of cascades

## Installation and setting up environment
Python, Anaconda, SNAP

## How to run the example?
Use ``master_usage.sh``.

## Main files
* ``simprop.py`` is the frontend.
* ``study.py`` defines the properties and methods pertaining to
  this study. It constructs the cascade graphs with properties specific to
  this study.
* ``simulator.py`` contains properties and methods to handle input from the
  simulator used.
* ``cascade.py`` contains the definition of the cascade graph. This is the
  core file for cascade graph construction and transformation.
* ``properties.py`` is where all properties are computed.

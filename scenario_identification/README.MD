# Scenario Identification Notebooks

We include here two notebooks: ``identification-analysis.ipynb`` and ``example.ipynb``

``identification-analysis.ipynb`` includes a more full reproduction of the
analysis done to assess learnability at different coverages, and at
different times, and to assess parameter significance. However, it requires
data that we are not able to make public at this time. We include this in
order to further transparency and reproducibility.

We also include ``example.ipynb`` as an example that can be run using the
data that can be found in this repository. It demonstrates the training and
evaluation procedure we used for the models. It uses data from
``../examples/ml_table/``.
